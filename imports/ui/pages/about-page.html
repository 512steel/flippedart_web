            <p>What started as a side project, setting up chalkboards on a college
            campus with no motivation other than to elicit some interesting responses,
            has become the basis of this site.  A library system to extend the life of
            public art projects beyond their initial offerings.</p>

            <h4 class="push-down">How it works</h4>

            <p>Signing up is easy, and once you’ve created an account you are free to
            post updates on the success of your latest project and upload items or
            materials that you’ve used in the past and would like to make available
            to others.  You can browse anyone’s <a href="{{pathFor 'userInventoryPage' username='Alex'}}">items</a>
            and request them by clicking
            on the link from their profile page.  Once you’ve requested something,
            you’re taken to a private chat window with the owner to discuss further
            logistical details with them.  If they approve your request, you will
            become the proud owner of their materials!</p>

            <p>After you’ve finished a public art project of your own, pay it forward by
            uploading your materials here to let others use them in their own communities.</p>
