        <h4>Who we are</h4>
        <p>
            Flipped Art is a maker community reaching across Des Moines.  It was started by
            <a href="{{pathFor 'profile.page' username='alex'}}"
               class="username-tag">
                Alex
            </a>
            and
            <a href="{{pathFor 'profile.page' username='Whitney'}}"
               class="username-tag">
                Whitney
            </a>,
            who both want to make the world a little weirder.
        </p>

        <h4>We need your help</h4>
        <p>
            Yes, you.  For the creative community to work we need to engage the whole
            community – not just the Artists with a capital ‘A’.  If you’re a living
            human being then you have a story to share and a bridge to build.  We can help
            you make that happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flipped Art is an experiment in our collective capacity to make and share
            new experiences, made by and for the Des Moines community.  Breaking down the
            barriers of the art scene will only happen when everyone is involved,
            not just a select few.
        </p>

        <h4>A bit more background</h4>
        <p>
            Behold our mission statement: Flipped Art is a Des Moines-based maker community,
            online sharing space, and mobile studio. For established artists, there are lots of
            great opportunities for sharing work in the local community.  But for people without
            a designated studio, hobbyists, and underprivileged groups, the options are much
            slimmer.  Des Moines may not be boring, but there is a lot more to be done to reach
            the whole creative city.  Wannabes are welcome here.
