            How to use this site
        </h1>
        <p>
            This website is the online hub for Des Moines' local creative community.  Below are
            some tips for using it.  Don't hesitate to ask questions of other community members!
        </p>

        <h5 class="pull-down">
            Sharing
        </h5>
        <p>
            Communities work best when the members share and grow with each other.  If somebody
            else in the area could put a creative project you've made to good use, make it available on
            here so that others can request it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add any projects you've been working on or have completed
            <a href="{{pathFor 'projects.add'}}">
                here
            </a>.
            Be sure to keep the "available" checkbox checked.  Once somebody requests your project,
            you will receive a notification and can open a chatroom between yourself and that user.
            Use this chatroom to discuss your locations, what they'll use the project for, or anything
            else.  Set the wheels in motion by going to

            {{#if currentUser}}
                <a href="{{pathFor 'exchanges.user' username=currentUsername}}">
                    your exchanges
                </a>
            {{else}}
                <a href="{{pathFor 'signin'}}">
                    your profile
                </a>
            {{/if}}

            and clicking the "approve" button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the chatroom to discuss the logistics of where and when you'll meet to exchange your
            project with the person who requested it.  Once you've met in-person and the project has
            physically changed hands, click the "complete" button.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's it!  You've successfully shared your project with another community member.
            <strong>Here's the catch:</strong> exchanges work so that the person who requested the
            project will become that project's new official owner.  If you request and receive
            a project from somebody else, it's up to you to pay it forward in the future.
        </p>

            Posting
        </h5>
        <p>
            If you're working on something cool, meeting up with other local artists, or know about
            somebody else's awesome creative project, let people know!  You can post updates from

            {{#if currentUser}}
                <a href="{{pathFor 'profile.page' username=currentUsername}}">
                    your profile
                </a>
            {{else}}
                <a href="{{pathFor 'signin'}}">
                    your profile
                </a>
            {{/if}}

            and comment on other people's posts.
