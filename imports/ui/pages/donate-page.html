        <!--<p>
            Membership in Flipped Art's governance is based on a monthly donation, but
            it doesn't cost a thing to use our materials and space at official events.
            Although donations are gladly accepted, our number one goal is to be open and accessible
            to as many people as possible.
        </p>-->
        <p>
            We are a nonprofit trying to reach the underserved creative community
            in Des Moines. Providing free materials and space isn't free, so anything you
            can donate is hugely appreciated. If you come to the makerspace or mobile studio,
            you'll get a high-five!
        </p>
