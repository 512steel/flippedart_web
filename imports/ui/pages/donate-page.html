        <h1>Donations and memberships</h1>
        <p>
            The Flipped Art website is still under construction, but this is where we
            will accept secure online donations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Membership in Flipped Art's governance is based on a monthly donation, and
            it doesn't cost a thing to use our materials and space at official events.
            Donations are gladly accepted, but our number one goal is to be open and accessible
            to as many people as possible.
