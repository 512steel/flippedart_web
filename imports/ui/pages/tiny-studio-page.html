                        In summer 2016, two weirdos decided to build an art studio.  It would have
                        everything you could want: a messy floor, canvases free for the painting,
                        and cool people to hang around with.  The only problem?  The two weirdos
                        couldn’t decide where to put it once it was built.  At an impasse like that,
                        the only option was to put it on wheels.

                        They (that’s us! in the picture!) decided to turn their idea into
                        a whole shebang of an operation, forming a nonprofit and getting
                        grant funding.  Alex is a Des Moines native and Whitney has lived here for
                        the last four years.  We know parts of the city well, but parts of the
                        local arts community have always felt locked off.

                        Flipped Art began with haphazard attempts at breaking in to Des Moines’
                        art scene.  We hosted pop-up events with and without permission, where people
                        had their days interrupted while they worked side-by-side to make something
                        together.  Adults stood next to kids, who stood next to established area
                        artists, who stood next to executives, who stood next to people who never
                        thought they’d pick up a paintbrush.

                        The more events we hosted, the more impressed we were at the potential of
                        community-sourced art.  The more it became apparent how many people could
                        benefit from creative activity, even if that activity wasn’t a
                        planned part of their day.  And the less important it was for someone to be
                        a part of the “art scene” to participate in something creative and
                        interesting and unexpected.

                        Our early plans for establishing a permanent makerspace in downtown Des Moines
                        took a backseat.  We shifted toward the Tiny Studio – an art
                        studio literally hitched to a trailer, which can be pulled to the local
                        communities rather than asking them to come to us.  It’s Iowa’s first
                        mobile makerspace.

                    <p>
                        We built the Tiny Studio by hand this summer, and made sure that
                        it had a few key features:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weird shape</li>
                        <li>Chalkboard walls</li>
                        <li>A hatch door that opens to the sidewalk</li>
                        <li>Small enough to be towed by a Corolla</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Soon, it will have solar panel roofing and turn into a Transformer.
                        But one step at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Tiny Studio is for you.  It’s our first stab at eliminating
                        access barriers to the arts, and we are working hard to make sure
                        that it’s just as available to everyone who wants to use it.
                        It also means that we want your
                        <a href="{{pathFor 'static.feedback'}}">feedback</a> to make sure we
                        stock it with materials and activities that are relevant and engaging.

                        tell the story of us building the Tiny Studio but with scragglier
