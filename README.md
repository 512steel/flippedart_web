# Flipped Art Website

[flippedart.org](https://www.flippedart.org) is built with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) and MongoDB.  This app follows the structure of the [sample "todos" app](https://github.com/meteor/todos), developed by Meteor, in order to follow a standard of best practices for security and app flow in a relatively new framework.

### What it does

The code here handles all of the functionality you see on the live website.  Static pages, user accounts, social features (posting/liking/commenting/flagging), user projects, and the project transaction flow.  

### How to contribute

If you see something that should be added or changed, open an issue on GitHub.  Feel free to add a pull request as well.  The big piece that needs to be put in place is proper tests using Meteor's testing framework.  We hope to encourage collaboration here as much as we do with the rest of the Flipped Art community, so getting things like tests in place will be an important step toward that goal.
