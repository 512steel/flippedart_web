# Flipped Art Website

[flippedart.org](https://www.flippedart.org) is built with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) and MongoDB.  This app follows the structure of the [sample "todos" app](https://github.com/meteor/todos), developed by Meteor, in order to follow a standard of best practices for security and app flow in a relatively new framework.

### What it does

The code here handles all of the functionality you see on the live website.  Static pages, user accounts, social features (posting/liking/commenting/flagging), user projects, and the project transaction flow.  

### How to contribute

If you see something that should be added or changed, open an issue on GitHub.  Feel free to make a branch and add a pull request as well.
